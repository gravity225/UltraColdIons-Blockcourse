# UltraColdIons Blockcourse
 Code for Dataanalysis of the Blockcourse experiments.

 Determining the noise of a laser by calibrating voltage and frequency.
 After calibration curve, measure the voltage at constant frequency over time.
 With the convertion factor we acheive frequency again.

 A fourie transform of the time dependant signal will give us the noise power spectral density (note to me: think about intensity).

 Determine beta-limit and analyse integrals, determine areas A1 und A2 under the curve.
